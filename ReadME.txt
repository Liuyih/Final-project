Introduction:
The name of our language is "Calculator Haskell Program" and the language's paradigm is "Imperative language view computation". Our program can do some general calculators such as addiction, subtraction, multiplication and division. Additionally, we add statements like less than, equal, greater than that can return bool value. The interesting part in our program is that we are trying to implement For loop by using the Haskell, and implement it in semantics.

Our program is not completed yet. Examples provided may return error. 

Compile:

$ ghci Design.hs
